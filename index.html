                    Hi, I'm Allan. I have 10+ years of experience in product and visualization design. Currently, I do R&amp;D at the Accenture Tech Labs on topics of data analytics, AR/VR, and AI. I'm sort of a designer / developer hybrid since I work with data structures as much as wireframes. Below are some highlights of what I've worked on.

                       An industry analyst's research work typically involves manual hit or miss term searching, while topic discovery and coverage is limited by what they are able find before short deadlines. Applying AI techniques, such as natural language processing and topic modeling, can greatly improve an analyst's research results.

                      The overall research goal was to develop an application prototype that an analyst can quickly integrate into their current work flow with minimal retraining or retooling. The prototype must also be highly scalable and easily deployed for use in consulting delivery centers with thousands of potential users.

                        As the lead product designer, my task was to map out the analyst's typical process, understand their goals and restraints, and develop a feature set that could integrate with our team's developed AI techniques. As this would be a technical demo as well as a prototype, I also had to design and build a front end interface that was understandable for both analysts and general business audiences.

                        The project began with a series of user interviews to distill the typical research process. Major pain points included: finding productive search terms while researching unfamiliar industries, the time consuming nature of parsing results for relevant information or trends, and the scatter-shot approach to saving information. Working iteratively with an AI expert, several techniques were developed that could augment and integrate into the analyst's process. Those were then used to inform multiple sketch concepts and quickly refined into a working application for user testing and AI algorithm refinement.

                        While several concepts were considered, the final design settled on a simple yet familiar search bar and results list interface. Integrating OneNote into the tool contained all action within the browser and provided a streamlined way to record information lineage within projects. Now an analyst could start research in a new industry, be immediately presented with relevant search term suggestions, have the results quickly summarized into major topics, and then see those topics in the context of trends.

                       The prototype application was well received and its code base transferred for production. The project also provided an exemplary use case for client discussions around applying human centered design principles to guide the application of AI capabilities. The key to a successful design relies on understanding where AI is best suited to augment a process, and where processes need to be changed to augment the AI.

                        A key challenge, when incorporating AI as another stakeholder in the design process, is the uncertainty of its abilities until later stages of the development. Often, it can function much like a black box. However, the successful implementation of an AI system can make user interactions much more natural. As the system takes on a greater cognitive load, the user is then free to focus more on their primary task.

                        As 360 videos become more prevalent, providing feedback on viewer engagement is particularly important to aid content providers of this new medium.

The red triangles represent the travel of viewer's gaze. Sections in the video where multiple viewer's gaze converge correspond to spikes in the red line chart below, revealing areas of interest or frustration during the video.

                       Visualization is one of the most effective ways of communicating patterns and insights from data sets. The recent proliferation of visualization tools on the web has rapidly increased its accessibility, yet an understanding of best practices or effective application is often lacking.

In such cases, geospatial maps are ideal because they are quickly understandable and have high information density.

The geospatial chart emphasized regional patterns of loan delinquency, including an interesting pattern of strategic defaulters, as well as the dramatic increase during the market crash. The 3D bubble plot concentrated on quickly providing a high level comparison of selected bank's entire loan portfolio health and strategy. The network graph demonstrated how loan type similarities converged over time, as standards became more lax, exposing loan portfolios to greater hidden risk.

                        The visualization agenda and demonstrations were highly praised and well received, forming the basis of countless client proposals and capability presentations.

                        The hands on nature of creating several data visualization applications provided key experience that helped ensure successful delivery of future work. Some especially valuable insights include a realization that 80% of a project's effort will go towards gaining access to, correctly formatting, and understanding the data before any visualization application can begin to be developed. This ties into the need to connect the data to visualizations as quickly as possible, because of the uncertainty of what it might reveal. The highly indeterminate and iterative process, therefore, requires a strong team with a broad mix of specialty skills.

                        As tools like Tableau and Qlik become more prominent for business, the skills needed to effectively use data visualizations increased in demand. While some tutorials and guides were available, information was scattered and incomplete. Simple templating or rote based approaches would not be sufficient for the numerous client demands of such a large company. Consequently, the Visual Literacy Curriculum (VLC) was commissioned and quickly took on a design principle centered approach.

                        Because of the massive scale of the firm and the need for improved visual literacy across all employee career levels, a multi-vector approach to training was necessary. Course work and materials would have to be accessible online and self guided, supplemented by strategic, in person workshops to skill-up groups that could then promote best practices within their regions. Finally, an online community would be established as a centralized repository for resources and skilled personnel information.

                        The Visual Literacy Curriculum (VLC) is comprised of a large internal online community, multiple online courses, and a hands on workshop. Centered around the themes of data representation, design principles, and storytelling, the curriculum was developed to improve a person's ability to understand, evaluate, and create effective data visualizations. Emphasizing an iterative, sketch driven design process, the VLC also helps trainees communicate in design terms, critique work, and create visualizations specifically tailored to their user's needs and data.

                        The VLC course material revolves around three sections. Data Representation details how to map data to combinations of visual elements, such as position or area, how these relate to perceptual accuracy, fundamentals of chart components and chart selection, and how to critique. Design Principles references the application of abstract concepts, such as proximity and emphasis, to control design attributes like white space and visual hierarchy. And lastly, Storytelling with Data introduces the idea of the persona, presentation context, and techniques for arranging story elements to form an appropriate narrative for a determined audience. All this is framed to familiarize trainees with a common design language and technique.

                        The VLC had a successful roll out and was one of the earlier company wide pushes towards embracing design thinking.

Several individuals were certified as trainers and continue to run VLC workshops in their regions.

                        The hardest challenge to training individuals is getting them to absorb course material. Course work can only go so far, but one of the most interesting insights came through the refinement of the workshops. Initially there were several sections requiring computers to create and present visualizations, but these proved to be cumbersome. Very quickly we simply replaced computers with more sketching, and this was surprisingly well received as presentations and concept retention vastly improved.
